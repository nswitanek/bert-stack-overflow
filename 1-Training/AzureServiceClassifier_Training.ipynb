    "One of the key tasks to ensuring long term success of any Azure service is actively responding to related posts in online forums such as Stackoverflow. In order to keep track of these posts, Microsoft relies on the associated tags to direct questions to the appropriate support team. While Stackoverflow has different tags for each Azure service (azure-web-app-service, azure-virtual-machine-service, etc), people often use the generic **azure** tag. Questions without appropriate tags are less likely to be found by the teams that can help, and so many untagged and generically tagged questions are unanswered. \n",

    "We will be using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model which was published by researchers at Google AI Reasearch. Unlike prior language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks without substantial architecture modifications.\n",

The result jumped to 90% once researchers adopted BERT as the core language understanding component. With BERT Aristo now solves the test with A grade.  "
